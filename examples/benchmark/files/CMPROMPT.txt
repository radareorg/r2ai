Compare the two provided code in C with the decompiled counterpart. Ignore function or variable names, syntax differences, language-specific constructs, and formatting. Focus solely on what the code does: the operations performed, control flow, logic, and functional behavior. Determine if they are functionally equivalent in terms of their effects and computations.

Output only:
- A numeric score from 1 to 100 (100 being identical logic and functionality)
- Followed by a single sentence describing the most relevant semantic differences (or "No significant semantic differences" if score is 95+)

**Original Source Code:**

```C

```

**Decompiled Code:**
