  decai: `# Using Decai

Decai is the radare2 plugin for decompiling functions with the help of language models.

By default uses a local ollama server, but can you can pick any other service by using 'decai -e api=?'.

[0x00000000]> decai -e api=?
r2ai deepseek anthropic gemini hf mistral ollama openapi openai vllm xai

## Using Ollama

* Visit https://ollama.com to install it.
* Download the model of choice: 'ollama run llama3.3'
* Configure decai to use the given model with: 'decai -e model=?'

These are the most recommended models for decompiling in local:

* hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:latest (18GB of ram)
* hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:32b (24GB of ram required)

## Common Options
* 'decai -e baseurl=<url>' override default host and port for API endpoint (e.g., 'http://localhost:11434')

* 'decai -e deterministic=true' to remove randomness from decompilation responses
* 'decai -e lang=Python' to output the decompilation in Python instead of C
* 'decai -e hlang=Catalan' to add comments or explanations in that language (instead of English)
* 'decai -e cmds=pdd,pdg' use r2dec and r2ghidra instead of r2's pdc as input for decompiling
* 'decai -e prompt=..' default prompt must be fine for most models and binaries, feel free to tweak it

## API Keys

Remove services like OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic, Grok, Gemini, .. require API keys to work.

See 'decai -k' to list the status of available APIkeys

Decai will pick them from the environment or the config files in your home:

* echo KEY > ~/.r2ai.openai-key
* export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

## Using the R2AI Server:

Install r2ai or r2ai-server with r2pm:

[0x0000000]> decai -e api=r2ai
[0x0000000]> r2pm -ci r2ai

Choose one of the recommended models (after r2pm -r r2ai):

* -m ibm-granite/granite-20b-code-instruct-8k-GGUF
* -m QuantFactory/granite-8b-code-instruct-4k-GGUF
* -m TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF

Start the webserver:

$ r2pm -r r2ai-server -l r2ai -m granite-8...

  auto: `# Radare2 Auto Mode

Use function calling to execute radare2 commands in order to resolve the user request defined in the "User Prompt" section, analyze the responses attached in the "Command Results" section.

## Function Calling

Respond ONLY using plain JSON. Process user query and decide which function calls are necessary to solve the task.

1. Analyze the user request to determine if we need to run commands to extend the knowledge and context of the problem.
2. If function call is needed, construct the JSON like this:
 - Fill the "action" key with the "r2cmd" value.
 - Specify the "command" as a string.
 - Optionally, provide a "reason" and "description"
3. If the answer can be provided and no more function calls are required:
 - Use the key "action": "reply".
 - Include "response" with the direct answer to the user query.

Return the result as a JSON object.

### Sample Function Calling Communication

Command Results: already performed actions with their responses
User Prompt: "Count how many functions we have here."
Response:
{
    "action": "r2cmd",
    "command": "aflc",
    "description": "Count functions"
    "reason": "Evaluate if the program is analyzed before running aaa"
}

## Rules

Use radare2 to resolve user requests.

* Explain each step in the "reason" field of the JSON.
* Follow the initial analysis instructions.
* Output only valid JSON as specified.
* Decompile and inspect functions, starting from main.
* Run only the needed commands to gather info.
* Use "@ (address|symbol)" to seek temporarily.
* Output should be a verbose markdown report.
* Use "sym." or "fcn." prefixes if "pdc" is empty.
* If a seek fails, use "f~name" to find the symbol's address.

### Initial Analysis

1. Run "aflc" to count the number of functions
2. If the output of "aflc" is "0" run "aaa" once, then "aflc" again
3. Run only one command at a time (do not use ";")

### Special cases

* On Swift binaries run...
